This file presents 100-percent population and housing figures for the total population, for 63 race categories, and for many other race and Hispanic or Latino categories. This includes age, sex, households, household relationship, housing units, occupancy status, and tenure (whether the residence is owned or rented). Also included are selected characteristics for a limited number of race and Hispanic or Latino categories. The data are available for the U.S., regions, divisions, states, counties, county subdivisions, places, census tracts, block groups, blocks, metropolitan areas (2000), core based statistical areas (2010), American Indian and Alaska Native areas, tribal subdivisions, Hawaiian home lands, congressional districts, and ZIP Code Tabulation Areas. Data are available down to the block level for many tabulations, but only to the census-tract level for others. The 2010 Census SF 1 has some tables on the population in group quarters that are available only to the county level. Available on DVD and American FactFinder.  The Census 2000 Summary File 1 data were released in three stages. Individual state files and two national files were released. The state-level data were released first, followed by the Advance National File, which covered the same data subjects, but includes national level summary data for areas that cross state boundaries such as whole metropolitan areas, whole American Indian areas, etc. The Final National File contains the same data subjects and geographic areas as the Advance National File, but adds the first available urban/rural and urbanized area data. For the most current release dates for these files, see the ""Census 2000 Release Schedule"" link on the AFFAmerican FactFinder Main Page.  The 2010 Census Summaray File 1 data were released in stages. Individual state files and a national update were released in 2011. The SF 1 urban/rural update is planned for release in Fall 2012. This file contains the same data subjects as the previously released files, but for additional geography, including the urban and rural parts of the United States, regions, divisions, states, counties, and places; and urbanized areas and urban clusters.

Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.

An establishment is a single physical location at which business is conducted or services or industrial operations are performed. It is not necessarily identical with a company or enterprise, which may consist of one or more establishments. When two or more activities are carried on at a single location under a single ownership, all activities generally are grouped together as a single establishment. The entire establishment is classified on the basis of its major activity and all data are included in that classification. Establishment-size designations are determined by paid employment in the mid-March pay period. The size group ""1 to 4"" includes establishments that did not report any paid employees in the mid-March pay period but paid wages to at least one employee at some time during the year. Establishment counts represent the number of locations with paid employees any time during the year. Sources of the Data Payroll and employment data are tabulated from administrative records for single-unit firms and a combination of administrative records and survey-collected data for multi-unit firms. Read more >> Geographic Area Coding Most geography codes are derived from the physical location address reported in Census Bureau programs. The Internal Revenue Service and the Bureau of Labor Statistics provide supplemental address information. Reliability of Data The data are not subject to sampling error, but are subject to nonsampling errors, which can be attributed to several sources: inability to identify all cases that should be in the universe; definition and classification difficulties; errors in recording or coding the data obtained; and other errors of coverage, processing, and estimation for missing or misreported data. Read more >> Dollar Values All dollar values presented in the reports from the ZIP Code Business Patterns are expressed in current dollars, i.e, 2009 data are expressed in 2009 dollars and 2008 data in 2008 dollars. Consequently, when making comparisons to prior years, data users should take into consideration the inflation that has occurred. All dollar values, unless noted otherwise, are shown in thousands of dollars. Disclosure In accordance with federal law (U.S. Code, Title 13, Section 9) no data are published that would disclose the operations of an individual establishment or business. Noise Infusion: ZIP Code Business Patterns apply the Noise Infusion method of data protection. Noise infusion is a method used to protect data in which values for each establishment such as first-quarter payroll, annual payroll, and number of employees are perturbed prior to publication by applying a random noise multiplier to the data for each company. This method results in a relatively small change to the vast majority of cell values. Read more >> The number of establishments in a particular tabulation cell is not considered a disclosure; therefore, this information may be released without the addition of protective noise.
